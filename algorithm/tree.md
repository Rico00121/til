The focus is the information of each node itself.
# Dynamic Programming
The focus is the information of the sub-problem. Or we can say it is the information of all of its **sub-tree**.
# Backtracking
The focus is the information of branches, how to make choses, how to backtrack(return to last status). Actually it is a **pointer** walking on the branches.
