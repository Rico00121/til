# Authentication and Authorization

## Authentication
Authentication is to verify whether the user is recorded in the system.

Exsit ->> pass, go to authorization step

Don't exist ->> access denied

## Authorization
Authorization is to give your some grants based on your account.

These grants will be checked when you access some special resource. 

For example, a user can access admin page only when they are granted the `Admin` role.
