## 
Training set: Data used to train the model.

Univariate linear regression: Linear regression with one variable.

## Notation
$x$ = input variable, feature

$y$ = output variable, target variable

$m$ = number of training examples

$(x,y)$ = single training examples

$(x^{(i)},y^{(i)})$ = $i^{th}$ training example

$\hat{y}$ = the prediction output $y$, it is a estimate

$f_{w,b} = wx + b$ = a function that takes x as input and depending on the value of w and b, f will out put some value of a prediction y-hat
