# What is Machine Learning
> Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly programed.   - Arthur Samuel(1959)

# Machine Learning Algorithms
Two types:
- Supervised learning
    - Regression
    - Classification
- Unsupervised learning
    - Recommender system
    - Reinforcement learning

## Supervised learning
Used most in real-world applications.

Learns from being given "right answers", the corret label y for a given input x.

x -> y mapping

### Regression
Predict a number from infinitely many possible outputs.

### Classification
Predict categories from small number of possible outputs (limited sets). 

Find the boundary line from data
